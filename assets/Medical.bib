  abstract = {A crucial bottleneck in medical artificial intelligence (AI) is high-quality labeled medical datasets. In this paper, we test a large variety of wisdom of the crowd algorithms to label medical images that were initially classified by individuals recruited through an app-based platform. Individuals classified skin lesions from the International Skin Lesion Challenge 2018 into 7 different categories. There was a large dispersion in the geographical location, experience, training, and performance of the recruited individuals. We tested several wisdom of the crowd algorithms of varying complexity from a simple unweighted average to more complex Bayesian models that account for individual patterns of errors. Using a switchboard analysis, we observe that the best-performing algorithms rely on selecting top performers, weighting decisions by training accuracy, and take into account the task environment. These algorithms far exceed expert performance. We conclude by discussing the implications of these approaches for the development of medical AI.},

  abstract = {Improving the accuracy of medical image interpretation is critical to improving the diagnosis of many diseases. Using both novices (undergraduates) and experts (medical professionals), we investigated methods for improving the accuracy of a single decision maker and a group of decision makers by aggregating repeated decisions in different ways. Participants made classification decisions (cancerous vs. noncancerous) and confidence judgments on a series of cell images, viewing and classifying each image twice. We first examined whether it is possible to improve individual-level performance by using the maximum confidence slating (MCS) algorithm (Koriat, 2012b), which leverages metacognitive ability by using the most confident response for an image as the 'final response.' We find MCS improves individual classification accuracy for both novices and experts. Building on these results, we show that aggregation algorithms based on confidence weighting scale to larger groups of participants, dramatically improving diagnostic accuracy, with the performance of groups of novices reaching that of individual experts. In sum, we find that repeated decision-making and confidence weighting can be a valuable way to improve accuracy in medical image decision-making and that these techniques can be used in conjunction with each other.

  abstract = {Improving the accuracy of medical image interpretation can improve the diagnosis of numerous diseases. We compared different approaches to aggregating repeated decisions about medical images to improve the accuracy of a single decision maker. We tested our algorithms on data from both novices (undergraduates) and experts (medical professionals). Participants viewed images of white blood cells and made decisions about whether the cells were cancerous or not. Each image was shown twice to the participants and their corresponding confidence judgments were collected. The maximum confidence slating (MCS) algorithm leverages metacognitive abilities to consider the more confident response in the pair of responses as the more accurate ``final response'' (Koriat, 2012), and it has previously been shown to improve accuracy on our task for both novices and experts (Hasan et al., 2021). We compared MCS to similarity-based aggregation (SBA) algorithms where the responses made by the same participant on similar images are pooled together to generate the ``final response.'' We determined similarity by using two different neural networks where one of the networks had been trained on white blood cells and the other had not. We show that SBA improves performance for novices even when the neural network had no specific training on white blood cell images. Using an informative representation (i.e., network trained on white blood cells) allowed one to aggregate over more neighbors and further boosted the performance of novices. However, SBA failed to improve the performance for experts even with the informative representation. This difference in efficacy of the SBA suggests different decision mechanisms for novices and experts.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate how medical-image classification decisions can be denoised by aggregating decisions on similar images. In our algorithm, the final decision on a target image is can- cerous if a percentage t of the k most similar images are can- cerous, else it is not cancerous. Similarity between images is calculated as the distance between representations from an artificial neural network. We vary k and t for novice and ex- pert participants using data from Trueblood et al. (2018) and Trueblood et al. (2021). We show that increasing k improves performance for novices, with their performance approaching that of experts. We also show that the algorithm is biased to- wards identifying cancerous cells, which is reflected in the rep- resentational space. The percentage t allows greater control over sensitivity and specificity and can be used to debias de- cisions. This algorithm is less effective for experts, partially explained by them giving similar responses on similar images.

  abstract = {Evidence accumulation models (EAM) have proven to be an invaluable tool in probing the dynamical properties of decisions over recent decades. However, much of this literature has studied decisions utilizing simple stimuli where the experimenter has perfect knowledge and control over stimulus properties. Here, we develop and test a new method for studying decisions involving naturalistic stimuli (medical images in this case) where the experimenter has neither perfect knowledge nor control of the stimuli properties. The central challenge in studying such decisions is to extract useful representations of images that can be associated with accumulation or drift rates in EAMs. Here, we couple a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with the diffusion decision model (DDM) to study how expert pathologists and novices make decisions involving the classification of digital images of blood cells as either normal (non-blast) or cancerous (blast). In our approach, the CNN is the basis of a function that translates each image into a drift rate for use in the DDM. Results of fitting the joint CNN-DDM model to choice and response time data demonstrates that (1) both novices and experts demonstrated substantial speed accuracy tradeoffs, (2) both were susceptible to biases introduced by the presentation of pre-stimulus probabilistic cues, and (3) experts were more adept at extracting useful information from images than novices. These results demonstrate that this is a fruitful approach to studying decisions involving complex stimuli that will open new avenues for studying questions not possible with existing methods. Furthermore, this approach is technically feasible and has the potential to be translated into other domains of decision-making research.},

  abstract = {Many important real-world decision tasks involve the detection of rarely occurring targets (e.g., weapons in luggage, potentially cancerous abnormalities in radiographs). Over the past decade, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that extreme prevalence (both high and low) leads to an increase in errors. While this ``prevalence effect'' is well established, the cognitive and/or perceptual mechanisms responsible for it are not. One reason for this is that the most common tool for analyzing prevalence effects, Signal Detection Theory, cannot distinguish between different biases that might be present. Through an application to pathology image-based decisionmaking, we illustrate that an evidence accumulation modeling framework can be used to disentangle different types of biases. Importantly, our results show that prevalence influences both response expectancy and stimulus evaluation biases, with novices (students, N = 96) showing a more pronounced response expectancy bias and experts (medical laboratory professionals, N = 19) showing a more pronounced stimulus evaluation bias.},

  abstract = {Training individuals to make accurate decisions from medical images is a critical component of education in diagnostic pathology. We describe a joint experimental and computational modeling approach to examine the similarities and differences in the cognitive processes of novice participants and experienced participants (pathology residents and pathology faculty) in cancer cell image identification. For this study we collected a bank of hundreds of digital images that were identified by cell type and classified by difficulty by a panel of expert hematopathologists. The key manipulations in our study included examining the speed-accuracy tradeoff as well as the impact of prior expectations on decisions. In addition, our study examined individual differences in decision-making by comparing task performance to domain general visual ability (as measured using the Novel Object Memory Test (NOMT) (Richler et al. Cognition 166:42--55, 2017). Using signal detection theory and the diffusion decision model (DDM), we found many similarities between experts and novices in our task. While experts tended to have better discriminability, the two groups responded similarly to time pressure (i.e., reduced caution under speed instructions in the DDM) and to the introduction of a probabilistic cue (i.e., increased response bias in the DDM). These results have important implications for training in this area as well as using novice participants in research on medical image perception and decision-making.},
